# terraform-ops-manager
The objective of this repository is to build a set of configurable Terraform scripts that creates an Ops Manager test environment on AWS.

## 1 Disclaimer
These code samples are provided for educational and illustrative purposes only, to demonstrate the functionality of specific MongoDB features. They are not production-ready and may lack the security hardening, error handling, and testing required for a live environment.

You are responsible for testing, validating, and securing this code within your own environment before implementation. This material is provided "as is" without warranty or liability.’

## 2 Structure of Repo
```

├── 1-om
├── 2-clusters
├── init-scripts
├── misc
├── modules
│   ├── ec2
│   └── s3
└── scripts
```
The main folders that you need to use are:
- `1-om`: Terraform scripts that create:
  - Ops Manager application
  - AppDB
- `2-clusters`: Terraform scripts that creates:
  - Test instances
  - Backup database (Oplog/Block store, S3 metadata store)
  - S3 buckets for backup (Oplog/Snapshot)

Due to the limitation of Terraform, I can't do everything in 1 phase. You need to finish `1-om` then start `2-clusters`.

## 3 Use the Tool
### 3.1 Required Variables
I tried to make everything autowired so you only need to fill some necessary information. The other variables can let you customize the Ops Manager but they have defaults. 
All the important variables are described below. You can find in `1-om/variables.tf` all the other variables and instructions.

#### aws_config
##### aws_config.region
_Required_  
AWS region that you want to create the environment.

##### aws_config.vpc_id
_Required_  
The VPC ID that you want to host the environmenbt. The VPC must exist and can assign public IP addess for the EC2 instances.

##### aws_config.sub_net
_Required_  
The subnet where you want to create the EC2 instances. The subnet must exist.

##### aws_config.key_name
_Required_  
The AWS key pair that will be assigned to all the EC2 instances. You can use the key to ssh the instances.

#### tags
##### tags.owner
_Required_  
Your MongoDB email.

##### tags.expire-on
_Optional_  
Use empty string auto fill a date that represents 3 days later. Otherwise please fill in the format of: `yyyy-MM-dd`.

##### tags.project-id
_Optional_  
Defaults to `internal`. You have responsibility to fill the real PS project ID from Salesforce. The format is: `PS-<project ID>`.

#### backing_db_credentials
##### backing_db_credentials.name
_Required_  
Name of user that will be created in all backing databases as `root` user. Including:
- AppDB
- Oplog/Block store
- S3 metadata store

##### backing_db_credentials.pwd
_Required_  
Password for the user above.

#### first_user
The first Ops Manager user. This will be the Ops Manager admin.

##### first_user.email
_Required_  
Email of the user.

##### first_user.pwd
_Required_  
Password of the user.

##### first_user.fistName
_Required_  
User's first name.

##### first_user.pwd
_Required_  
User's last name.

### 3.2 Deploy Ops Manager
#### AWS Credentials
- Open AWS from company portal.
- Click "Access keys"
- Copy credential from "Option 1: Set AWS environment variables"
- Paste into bash

#### Execute Script
Create Ops Manager:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangyaoxing/terraform-ops-manager
cd 1-om
terraform init
terraform apply
```
Create the rest:
```bash
cd 2-clusters
terraform init
terraform apply
```
Destroy the environment:
```bash
cd 2-clusters
terraform destroy
cd ../1-om
terraform destroy
```

## 4 Known Issues
### 4.1 Cloudflare
Cloudflare WARP is known to prevent us from sending big post requests. Thus the automation API requests in `2-clusters` will fail.  
Turn off Cloudflare WARP or use DoH mode will fix the problem.

If you have finished `1-om` with WARP on, you need to go to Admin->Global Access List to whitelist your public IP so the script can work properly. Note the new whitelist takes 5 min to take effect.

### 4.2 Ops Manager API
There's no Terraform provider for Ops Manager. So I have to create some Python scripts to call the API, and use the `null_resource` to call the Python scripts. In this case, the resources (Orgs, Projects, Clusters) in Ops Manager will not be properly destroyed. This is usually harmless because they will be destroyed when you destroy Ops Manager.

### 4.3 Standalone AppDB
Although you can customize how many instances of backup DB, test DB you need, the AppDB currenly only support a single instance standalone. This should be enough for most use cases.

### 4.4 Certificates
Features that needs certificates are not supported at the moment. Including:
- HTTPS
- Queryable backup

### 4.5 Email
SMTP is not configured at the moment. All features that rely on the email will fail.
